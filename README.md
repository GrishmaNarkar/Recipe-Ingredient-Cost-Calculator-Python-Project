## 🧾 Recipe Ingredient Cost Calculator

### 📌 Project Overview

The **Recipe Ingredient Cost Calculator** is a Python-based tool that helps calculate the total cost of a recipe by taking dynamic user input for ingredients, quantities, and unit prices. It displays the cost breakdown in a tabular format using **Pandas** and generates a **bar chart** visualization with **Matplotlib**.

---

### ✅ Features

* Accepts multiple ingredients with quantities and prices
* Calculates cost per ingredient and total recipe cost
* Displays a clean summary table using **Pandas**
* Generates a visual cost breakdown using **Matplotlib**

---

### 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **Pandas**
* **NumPy**
* **Matplotlib**

---

### ▶ How It Works

1. Run the script in any Python environment.
2. Enter ingredient name, quantity (grams or units), and unit price (₹).
3. Type **`done`** when finished.
4. View:

   * **Tabular Summary** (ingredient, quantity, price, and cost)
   * **Bar Chart** for cost distribution

### 🔍 Future Enhancements

* Add currency conversion feature
* Export data to Excel or CSV
* Implement a GUI for easier input

Would you like me to **prepare a GitHub README file in proper Markdown format with badges and an example screenshot placeholder** so you can directly upload it to your repo? Or keep it minimal like this?
